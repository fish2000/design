description: 'The founding partners of Vidvox, artists in their own right, wrote their
  first realtime video apps because they had to -- they needed tools no one had invented
  yet. Now, their products are live-performance essentials, running on laptops backstage
  to power the stage shows of artists like Radiohead and Lady Gaga. In the early 2000s,
  Vidvox moved away from their early comissions-based sales towards a full line of
  supported software titles. I joined them for six months as a comprehensive design-directior.
  We worked together at all levels -- problems of product differentiation and executive
  communications policy were as important as pixels and pantone-swatch minutiae for
  the fledgeling enterprise. See also: http://www.vidvox.net/'
