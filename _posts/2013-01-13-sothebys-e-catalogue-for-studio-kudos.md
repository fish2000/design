I was brought in by Studio Kudos to update and refresh the Sotheby&#8217;s E-Catalogue &#8212; a flash application offering an unabridged online view of the famous catalogues published by Sotheby&#8217;s Auction House, navigable by both casual browsers and auction pros. The interface has powerful zoom and pan controls for close-up views of the artwork on offer, alongside detailed provenance and condition notes for each piece.
